Project Brief
--------
1.	I need to go to court to contest a ticket. I remember exactly where I was pulled over - I take the same route to school most days - but I'm not sure which court services the area and I know some courts serve multiple municipalities. I canâ€™t figure out where I need to go for court or how to get help with my case.2.
